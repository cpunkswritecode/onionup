### TO DO:

* Wireframe the different components
* Plan frontend/backend routes
* Users should be allowed to log in with JUST a username, optionally an email as well
* Ping sites on user's account at a fixed interval (e.g. every 5 seconds)
* Run tor from the server
* Distinguish between a downed website/service and our server being down
* Live graph on sites page
* Vue frontend to make single page app
* Ping from multiple locations?
* SMS option?
* Email when sites are down?

## Development

### For local development:

1. run tor from terminal
2. rails s
3. open localhost:3000 in browser

## Backup ideas

* Onion site crawler 
* Peer to peer distributed pingdom clone
