### Project Description

Pingdom inspired Tor uptime checker that displays the health of hidden services and clearnet websites 

User authentication
* Username (null: false)
* Password (null: false)
* Optional email
* Modal popup
* Recover account with email
* Devise gem 
* Explanation of why we chose devise encryption (how it adds to functionality)

User Settings
* Change password
* Add or edit email
* Autogenerated Profile picture

View index of saved URLs. Each site card has 
* Health (up or down)
* Ping Time
* Live graph (d3)
* URL
* Add new site button
* Tab different windows of time e.g., seconds, minutes, days, months
* Render time?

New URL 
* Allow ip address
* Allow any format of URL

Site show page
* Delete button
* Larger graph 
* Edit alias (customize)
* Edit description
* ip address 
* Download PDF? 
* Download CSV?

Settings section?
* Change color scheme?
* Edit units (e.g. ms vs s)?


Stretch Goals
* Ping sites even while offline and store information in DB
* Fullscreen or presentation dev mode 


### Technologies 
* Ruby on Rails
* VueJS
* D3 for graphs
* Tor
* Sidekiq
* Devise 


Health: How long site is up vs how long site is down
Pingtime: Ping response time
Successful load/loadtime
Click component on page


### TO DO:

* Wireframe the different components
* Plan frontend/backend routes
* Users should be allowed to log in with JUST a username, optionally an email as well
* Ping sites on user's account at a fixed interval (e.g. every 5 seconds)
* Run tor from the server
* Distinguish between a downed website/service and our server being down
* Live graph on sites page
* Vue frontend to make single page app
* Ping from multiple locations?
* SMS option?
* Email when sites are down?

## Development

### For local development:

1. run tor from terminal
2. rails s
3. open localhost:3000 in browser

## Backup ideas

* Onion site crawler 
* Peer to peer distributed pingdom clone
